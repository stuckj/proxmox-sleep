"""Fail unless every named rpm carries an OpenPGP signature over its header.

`gpgcheck=1` verifies a signature stored *inside* the package, so an unsigned
rpm cannot be installed from a repository that asks for one. nfpm signs only
when rpm.signature.key_file resolves to a readable key and reports success
either way, so a missing or empty key produces an unsigned package and a green
build. This asserts the signature is actually there.

It parses the rpm directly rather than shelling out to `rpm -K` because the
release runners are Ubuntu and have no rpm, and because `rpm -K` conflates
"unsigned" with "signed by a key I do not have" in its exit status.

With --key it also requires the signature to be by one of those keys (comma
separated), read from the signature's Issuer subpacket. The backfill needs that
distinction: after a key rotation every package is still signed, by the retired
key, and a presence-only test would report nothing left to do. It takes a set
rather than one id because gpg signs with a signing subkey when the key has
one, so the id on the signature need not be the primary's.

Verifying the signature is *cryptographically valid* is deliberately out of
scope — that needs the public key and rpm's own header canonicalisation, and it
is what installing from the live repository proves.

Usage: check-rpm-signature.py [--key <keyid>[,<keyid>...]] <package.rpm> ...
